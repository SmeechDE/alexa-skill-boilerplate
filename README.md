# alexa-skill-boilerplate
This boilerplate demonstrates a sample skill build with Amazon Alexa SDK and a AWS lambda hosted functionality.

ASK-CLI Note: There seems to be a bug when initializing ask-cli with a custom AWS profile, where it always takes your default profile. Fix for now: Go to ```~/../../usr/local/lib/node_modules/ask-cli/lib/utils/init-aws.js``` and overwrite the ```aws_profile```-Parameter with your custom AWS Profile in line 17.

## Requirements
AWS Lambda Account
Amazon Developer Account
initialized Alexa Skill Kit for Node.js

## Getting Started
clone this repo e.g. with ```git clone https://github.com/SmeechDE/alexa-skill-boilerplate.git```
in .ask/config add your endpoint in this form: ```ask-<skillType>-<skillName>-<profile>```
navigate in your lambda directories and ```npm i```
ask deploy

## Testing locally
For testing locally it is possible to use the ``àlexa-skill-test```package. When you dont have installed it globally you can start it from the root of your lambda code directory. After starting it with ``àlexa-skill-test```go to ```localhost:3000```in your browser. The autogenerated JSON is currently buggy and it is recommended to copy a JSON from the Alexa Developer Portal -> Alexa -> Getting Started -> Your Skill -> Test Section.

Note: If you get a timeout error when executing requests, disable the responsible code with a comment.

## Deploying
For a shorter deploy time you can deploy only parts of your skill:
ask deploy -t skill
ask deploy -t model
ask deploy -t lambda
